# very accurate bsod

very accurate bsod made in html

### how do i use it

please dont use this to skip school, i can't make the lines jagged.

if you're thinking of putting this on your website to get users to install malware, firstly, what the heck is wrong with you, and two, **the license allows for that**, as long as you give me credit :)

## requirements

You need the segoe ui font. (if loading in Windows mode)

## roadmap

**Strike-through'd text means complete**.

~~detect if you dont have font and display warn~~

*maybe* add macos screen as an option

*maybe* add (ubuntu) linux screen as an option

*maybe* something random

*for sure* mininify css file thingy whatever your mom

*maybe* auto fullscreen?

*scale* display size if your display size is small.

### latest changes

added warning for no font (and added alternate fonts just in case). this might not work because i am on a chromebook right now.

future william here, it did not. it wont work on my machine i am so angery
